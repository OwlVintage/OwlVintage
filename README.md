# OwlVintage

## What is OwlVintage?

OwlVintage is an application that utilizes the Owler API, a retro social network reminiscent of Twitter from the early 2000s. While OwlVintage is still in development, it diverges from the design and functionality of Owler, instead opting to adhere to the Material 3 design guidelines for a more modern aesthetic. Additionally, OwlVintage operates independently, restricted solely to the usage of Owler's public API and its available features.

As development progresses, OwlVintage will continue to evolve, incorporating feedback from users and adhering to best practices in software development and user experience design. Stay tuned for updates and announcements as OwlVintage approaches its official release.
